Asymmetrik Programming Challenge 2020

This is my take at the Programming Challenge #3 the In-browser Particle System. 


# Download Files 

There are two ways to download and run the program:

        1. Download from github as a .zip file
                - Once downloaded, unzip the file
                - Simply open the index.html file to run the animation
        2. Open from command line
                - Create file called UpneetProgrammingChallenge using 'mkdir UpneetProgrammingChallenge' 
                - Step into directory using 'cd UpneetProgrammingChallenge'
                - Run command 'git pull https://github.com/upneetsb/ProgrammingChallenge.git'
                - Open your finder/filesystem and go to the file UpneetProgrammingChallenge 
                - Open the index.html file to run the animation


# Running and Test Animation

Running the animation is easy, it is done by reading your keyboard keystrokes: 
        
        Playing and Pausing: To play and pause the animation all you need to do is hit the 'P' key on your keyboard. It is case insensitive. 

        Switching Animation: To switch from the snowy animation the fall rainy day animation, hit 'spacebar' on the keyboard.

        Increasing and Decreasing Pane size: To increase or decrease the pane size, simply: 

        'A' -> Decrease Pane Width [Will alert you when you try to decrease to below 400px]
        'S' -> Decrease Pane Height [Will alert you when you try to decrease to below 400px]
        'W' -> Increase Pane Height
        'D' -> Increase Pane Width [Will alert you when you try to increase width past screen size]
