Asymmetrik Programming Challenge 2020

This is my take at the Programming Challenge #3 the In-browser Particle System. 


To run the program all you need to do is download the associated folder labelled 'Project Folder' and open the index.html file provided. The animation should begin
right when you open the page. 


Playing and Pausing: To play and pause the animation all you need to do is hit the 'P' key on your keyboard. It is case insensitive. 

Switching Animation: To switch from the snowy animation the fall rainy day animation, hit 'spacebar' on the keyboard.

Increasing and Decreasing Pane size: To increase or decrease the pane size, simply: 

        'A' -> Decrease Pane Width [Will alert you when you try to decrease to below 400px]
        'S' -> Decrease Pane Height [Will alert you when you try to decrease to below 400px]
        'W' -> Increase Pane Height
        'D' -> Increase Pane Width [Will alert you when you try to increase width past screen size]
